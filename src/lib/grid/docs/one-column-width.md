<apto-container>
    <apto-row>
        <apto-col>1 of 3</apto-col>
        <apto-col xs="6">2 of 3 (wider)</apto-col>
        <apto-col>3 of 3</apto-col>

You can set the width of one column and have the sibling columns automatically resize around it. Note that the other columns will resize no matter the width of the center column.
